  <h3>Lablebi, spicy flavor for cold days.</h3>
  <p>Lablebi is prepared quickly in casual cafeteria-style joints but the food is anything but unhealthy.
      <br> It is traditionally served quite simply, as it's a dish meant to provide sustenance for cold days, using frugal ingredients. </p>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>
        Place chickpeas in a large bowl and add water.<br>
         Allow the chickpeas to soak overnight. Make sure chickpeas are fully covered by the water. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Pour the chickpeas and the water they soaked in into a pot and bring to a boil. <br>
        Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, partially cover and allow to simmer until very tender.<br>
         Skim any foam that may develop at the surface.  
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        *Note: This may take 30-40 minutes, but you will know they are done when you can easily smash<br>
         them between your fingers and some of the skins start to separate from the chickpeas. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Once the chickpeas are fully cooked, add the salt, pepper, and cumin.<br>
         Stir and remove from heat.  
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Serve hot in a bowl and add your preferred garnish. You can go simple and <br>
        traditional with just pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil. Or go all out and<br>
         add the stale bread to soak up the broth, a generous spoonful of harissa, some good<br>
          quality Tunisian tuna, and a poached egg to top it all off. 
      </li>
