<h3>Tunisian Couscous: North African flavor</h3>
<p>Couscous is a North African dish traditionally served with meat, vegetables, and spices. It’s a staple dish in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, having Amazigh (Berber) origins. Its popularity stretches into Europe as well.</p>
<p>Couscous is Tunisia’s official national dish. But it’s more than just a staple food: for many families preparing and eating couscous is a ritual and a tradition that binds the generations together. In many ways, couscous is to Tunisia what pasta is to Italy – it’s not just food to put on the table, it’s a centerpiece of family life.</p>

    <li>- 200g cabbage, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>- 2-3 zucchini, quartered (200g)</li>
    <li>- 2-4 green peppers, whole</li>
    <li>- two potatoes, peeled and sliced in half
    </li>
    <li>-150g soaked chickpeas 
    </li>
    <li>- 1½ cups of extra virgin olive oil 
    </li>
    <li>- 1 teaspoon of harissa (or more if you are feeling adventurous)
    </li>
    <li>- 2 tablespoons of concentrated tomato paste 
    </li>
    <li>- ½ teaspoon salt and black pepper for seasoning 
    </li>
    <p>Optional:</p>
    <li>- 75g dried raisins or other fruit (not strictly traditional but tasty)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    
    <li>To prepare the sauce, put the meat with the onion and the olive oil in some water in the lower part of the keskes for a few minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the chickpeas, salt and black pepper, tomato paste, harissa, and carrots.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add 500mls of water, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the remaining vegetables and continue to cook.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Once the sauce is preparing, put the couscous in the upper pot of the steamer and place over the sauce. Leave for 20 minutes to allow the couscous to absorb the steam.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The couscous should be sprinkled with water and fluffed up (by hand if it is not too hot) every few minutes, to remove any clumps.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Return the couscous to steam for a further 5 minutes. If using raisins or other dried fruit add 5 minutes before the end.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Once the couscous and the vegetables are cooked, put the couscous in a large bowl and blend it with a tablespoon of olive oil or butter.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Mix the sauce with the couscous to get a nice red combination. Season and serve in a large communal bowl.</li>
